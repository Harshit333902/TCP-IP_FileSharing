Client Server File Transfer Application

It is a Java application application which transfers files with less hassles on the net through TCP sockets. In the application, two things have been considered- send file and receive file application. Since it's more user-centric application, to the clients and the servers, the application offers simple GUI.

## Features
- **File Transfer**: The files on the local machine can be selected for transfer to the server with ease.
- **File Receipt**: The received files are accepted by the server and saved in a particular directory so that it is easy to maintain a track of the files received.
- **User-friendly GUI**: The GUI eliminates command-line usage. It thus makes it easy for use by users of all calibers.
 
### Technologies
- **Java**: It is the language of core programming used for developing the application.
- **Swing**: To create a graphical user interface.
- **TCP/IP Sockets**: Enables net communication between client and the server.

## Setting Things Up
1. Setup: compile and run the server program that enables the service for file-receiving.
2. Operation Client: compile and run the client program, a file has to be chosen to upload it to the server.
3. Network Configuration : Client and server must be on the same local network to communicate.

This project illustrates the concepts of the client-server architecture and file handling in Java with actual application of socket programming and GUI development.
